- maven issues:
  
  after investigating, the root cause for mvn not working properly, is fact maven was installed with older version, here is the fix:
```bash
wget https://www-us.apache.org/dist/maven/maven-3/3.6.0/binaries/apache-maven-3.6.0-bin.tar.gz -P /tmp
sudo tar xf /tmp/apache-maven-*.tar.gz -C /opt
sudo ln -s /opt/apache-maven-3.6.0 /opt/maven
sudo ln -s /opt/maven/bin/mvn /usr/local/bin/mvn
mvn --version
```
What we are going to do today:

- deploying the output artifact into a target server:
